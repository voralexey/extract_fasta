# extract_fasta
Extract sequences from a fasta file based on a list of accession numbers

A Python3 script that takes two files as input: 
- accession_numbers_filterted.out (a list of accession numbers)
- SILVA_138.1_SSURef_NR99_tax_silva_trunc.fasta (a full bacterial 16S rRNA database from SILVA)

and produces a new parsed fasta file (fasta_parsed.txt)
